    "PCam an image classification dataset based off of one of the Camelyon16 tasks where 96x96, 3-color channel image patches are extracted from whole-slide images (WSI).  These slides were extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections in order to determine if the lymph nodes contain metastases (cancer cells).  From the Camelyon16 web page:\n",
    ">  This task has a high clinical relevance but requires large amounts of reading time from pathologists. Therefore, a successful solution would hold great promise to reduce the workload of the pathologists while at the same time reduce the subjectivity in diagnosis.
